**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Jonathan Chen**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   The Art of Web  
   W3Schools

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words).

   A challenge I encountered while creating this submission was rabbit hole syndrome. This was particularly true when the prework project introduced the AudioContext JavaScript library. I haven't used this musical toolkit before nor do I have much experience with sound synthesis, but it was definitely interesting to read the documentation related to it. The Art of Web article gave a great overview of it and provided many interactive sound samples. One of which sounded like it came straight from an old arcade game such as Pac-Man or Space Invader. I spent more time reading these articles than I probably should've, but I was able to pull myself out of the rabbit hole by reminding myself that there's a deadline to meet. I quickly bookmarked the articles that I was reading before the deadline ended up catching up to me. Not only that, I set mini deadlines for each of the required features I had to implement, so that I stayed on track throughtout the entire development process. This experience highlighted for me the importance of time management when it comes to web developement. Curiosity isn't a bad quality, but it shouldn't eat up too much or even all of my time.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   After completing my submission, some questions I have about web development pertain to JavaScript frameworks. This particular assignment was made with pure JavaScript which shows that you don't need anything too technically fancy to create a creatively and intellectually stimulating program. However, it makes me wonder when is the right time to pick up a JavaScript framework such as Angular or React. There seems to be many varying perspectives on this topic when I look at online discussions and blogs. Some vouch for a solid foundation in pure JavaScript and others say diving straight into a framework is the best approach. In any case, there's a lot more for me to learn and many exciting problems to tackle.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them adding additional features such as extra sound effects and different difficulty modes. For the sound effects, I would like to replicate the sound effects from classic arcade games. One idea that I have is replicating the lose sound effect from Pac-Man as the lose sound effecrt of my game. As for the difficulty modes, I think that having three difficulty settings such as easy, medium, and hard would be a feature that players will appreciate. The difficulty settings could be linked to the playback speed, so the harder the difficulty the faster the game.
